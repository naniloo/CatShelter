The Cat Shelter application

In this web application:

View a list of cats living in our Shelter. The list is displayed as a simple table. Each row will represent a cat, with its name, breed, coat, date of arrival as well as buttons to edit or delete it.
Create a new Cat entry when a cat arrives in the Shelter. This form will display as modal popup.
Edit an existing cat info. This is basically the same form as for creation, but pre-filled with the cat's information.
Delete an existing cat entry when this cat is adopted and leaves the Shelter. This action is done by clicking on the delete button present on each row on the cats list or from show/edit forms. A confirmation popup will be displayed before deletion.


A cat have the following properties :
	
Name
Breed (for more info see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cat_breeds)
Coat (we will stick to a choice among Hairless, Short, Semi-long, Long)
Date of arrival (to track since when the cat is in the Shelter)
